# Glossary üß†

This is the Airbyte Glossary built on top of the Second Brain or Digital Garden analogy. It's a single place for all data knowledge.

All the website-content are located in the `content` folder. All other folders are based on a framework called [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) (which uses [GoHugo](https://gohugo.io/)), an open-source [Digital Garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) or [Second Brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/).
