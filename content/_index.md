## A Single Place for All Data Knowledge
This is the Airbyte Glossary built on top of the [Second Brain] or [Digital Garden] analogy. 

Find all [Notes](notes) or by [Tags](tags). The Glossary is constantly evolving on topics around data and [#data engineering](tags/data-engineering). 

The Second Brain approach helps you learn more about topics and go deeper by clicking on relevant links that you see in the [Interactive Graphs] or Backlinks on each term. The graph also helps you see relations that you would not otherwise.

Everything on this Glossary is also open-source on GitHub and you can contribute if you like.
