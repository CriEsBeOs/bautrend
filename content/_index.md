## What is the Data Brain?
A single place for all data knowledge: It's the start of a data brain with data terms explained. It encourages you to learn more and go inside the brain to learn more.

To see all notes that the Data Brain contains, see [All Notes](notes) or by [Tags](tags). The Brain is constantly evolving on topics around data and [#data engineering](tags/data-engineering).
