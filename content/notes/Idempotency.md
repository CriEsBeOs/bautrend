Idempotency is the property of a particular operation that can be applied multiple times without changing the resulted outcome by being given the same inputs. It is used in [Functional Programming](notes/Functional%20Programming.md) and was the foundation for [Functional Data Engineering](notes/Functional%20Data%20Engineering.md).
