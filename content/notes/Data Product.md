[DJ Patil](https://twitter.com/dpatil), the former Chief Data Scientist of the United States, defined a data product as "a product that facilitates an end goal through data." Also, [[Data Mesh]] talks about "data as a product." It applies more product thinking, whereas the "Data Product" essentially is a dashboard, report, and table in a [[Data Warehouse]] or a Machine Learning model. Sometimes Data Products are also called [[Data Asset]]s.
