Data lake table formats are very attractive as they are databases on [Data Lake](term/data%20lake.md). Same as a table, one **data lake table format bundles distributed files into one table that is otherwise hard to manage**. You can think of it as an abstraction layer between your physical data files and how they are structured to form a table.

It is built on top o the [Storage Layer](term/storage%20layer.md) and [Data Lake File Format](term/data%20lake%20file%20format.md). Read more on our [Data Lake and Lakehouse Guide](https://airbyte.com/blog/data-lake-lakehouse-guide-powered-by-table-formats-delta-lake-iceberg-hudi).
