A Data Lakehouse open data management architecture that combines the flexibility, cost-efficiency, and scale of [Data Lake](term/data%20lake.md) with the data management and ACID transactions of [Data Warehouse](term/data%20warehouse.md) with Data Lake Table Formats (Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg & Hudi) that enable Business Intelligence (BI) and Machine Learning (ML) on all data.

The initial concept was created by Databricks in the [CIDR Paper](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf) in 2021. Read more on our [Data Lake and Lakehouse Guide](https://airbyte.com/blog/data-lake-lakehouse-guide-powered-by-table-formats-delta-lake-iceberg-hudi).
