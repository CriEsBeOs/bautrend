You can either click on `Edit Source` on each page and directly edit on GitHub or you can create a [New Issue](https://github.com/airbyteglossary/airbyteglossary.github.io/issues).

The nice thing is you can also run it locally and edit with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (if the GitHub direct edit is not enough or you want to change the design). 

For that, you can check a step-by-step manual [here](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/setup/) and the specific setting you need to have in Obsidian [here](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/obsidian/). Note that I pushed the Obsidian settings already to the GitHub repo, you only need to download Obsidian and open the Vault at `content/`(there is a hidden folder `content/.obsidian` that contains these already).
