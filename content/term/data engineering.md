Data Engineering mainly helps overcome the bottlenecks of [Business Intelligence](term/business%20intelligence.md):
- More transparency as tools are open-source mostly
- More frequent data loads?
- Extend additional [Machine Learning](term/machine%20learning.md) capabilities smoothly?

It's also the less famous sibling of data science.

Compared to existing roles it would be a **software engineering plus business intelligence engineer including big data abilities** as the [Hadoop](term/apache%20hadoop.md) ecosystem, streaming, and computation at scale. Business creates more reporting artifacts themselves but with more data that needs to be collected, cleaned, and updated near real-time and complexity is expanding every day. 

With that said more programmatic skills are needed similar to software engineering. **The emerging language at the moment is [[Python]]** ) while is used in engineering with tools alike [[Apache Airflow]], [Dagster](Dagster), etc. as well as data science with powerful libraries. 

As a data engineer, you use mainly [SQL](term/sql.md) for almost everything except when using external data from an API. Here you'd use [ELT](term/elt.md) tools or write some [[data pipelines]] with the tools mentioned above.
