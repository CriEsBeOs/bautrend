2022 marks JavaScriptâ€™s tenth year in a row as the most commonly used programming language. Always interesting to see the latest [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages). According to that survey,  people learning to code are more likely than Professional Developers to report using Python (58% vs 44%), C++ (35% vs 20%), and C (32% vs 17%).
