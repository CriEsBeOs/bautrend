The Modern Data Stack (MDS) is a heap of open-source tools to achieve end-to-end analytics from ingestion to transformation to ML over to a columnar data warehouse or lake solution with an analytics BI dashboard backend. This stack is extendable in any way needed, such as data quality, [Data Catalog](term/Data%20Catalog.md), etc.

The goal of an MDS is to get data insight with the best suitable tools for each part. It's noteworthy that it's a relatively new term and not yet 100% agreed on.
